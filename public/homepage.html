                            COVID-19, previously called the Novel Coronavirus, is a new strain of the family of Coronavirus viruses.
                            It is highly infectious and is the impetus for the ongoing 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. 
                            The disease is commonly characterised by symptoms of fever, 
                            cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include muscle pain, 
                            sore throat, loss of smell or taste and abdominal pain. 
                            In some cases the disease can be fatal.

                        This COVID-19 virus was discovered in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 and the disease has since spread globally resulting in the 2019-2020 global pandemic.
                        The first confirmed case was traced back to November of 2019 in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China. The virus is thought to have originated
                        from animals and made the leap to humans through the process known as a "Spillover Infection"; whereby a pathogen from one species
                        moves into another species. Further transmission was entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. Research done by the 
                        John Hopkins University ranks the virus with a 6.9% death-to-case ratio, however this number may vary by region.

                        The virus is mainly spread through the close contact of humans, specifically from respiratory
                        droplets from an infected person when they cough, sneeze or speak. The virus also has an incubation
                        period of typically around 5 days however, they may range between 2 to 14 days. The virus observed to be more severe to
                        older individuals and those who have compromised immune systems. Currently there is no 
                        known cure or treatment for the virus, although many medical institutions around the world
                        have been hard at work trying to come up with a cure.

            <li> <b>COMMON MYTHS</b><hr>
                <p>Ever since the news of COVID-19's existence was released, many myths began circling
                    the internet. One such misconception is the belif that 5G, a new mobile communications
                    technocology, actually aids the spread of the virus. This is completely false.
                    <b>5G does not help spread the coronavirus.</b>
                    </br>
                    Another myth is that the consumption of alcohol aids the body in defending the virus.
                    <b>The consumption of alcohol does not help to defend your body against the coronavirus.</b>
                    </br>
                    Futhermore, the myth that exposing your body to high temperatures will prevent
                    the virus from spreading in your body is also false. <b>Exposing yourself to high
                    temperatures does not prevent the coronavirus.</b>
                    </b>
