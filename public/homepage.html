                            cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include muscle pain, 
                            sore throat, loss of smell or taste and abdominal pain. 
                            In some cases the disease can be fatal.

                        COVID 19 was discovered in Wuhan, 
                        China in December of 2019.
                        The virus is mainly spread through the close contact of humans, specifically from respiratory
                        droplets from an infected person when they cough, sneeze or speak. Currently there is no 
                        known cure or treatment for the virus, although many medical institutions around the world
                        have been hard at work trying to come up with a cure.

            <li> <b>Common Myths</b>
                <p>Ever since the news of COVID-19's existence was released, many myths began circling
                    the internet. One such misconception is the belif that 5G, a new mobile communications
                    technocology, actually aids the spread of the virus. This is completely false.
                    <b>5G does not help spread the coronavirus.</b>
                    </br>
                    Another myth is that the consumption of alcohol aids the body in defending the virus.
                    <b>The consumption of alcohol does not help to defend your body against the coronavirus.</b>
                    </br>
                    Futhermore, the myth that exposing your body to high temperatures will prevent
                    the virus from spreading in your body is also false.<b>Exposing yourself to high
                    temperatures does not prevent the coronavirus.</b>
