                        The most effective measures for preventing coronavirus 
                        transmission are frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds, 
                        maintaining distance from other people, covering coughs and sneezes 
                        with the inner elbow or tissues and avoiding touching oneâ€™s own face. It is 
                        also recommended that those who exhibit symptoms isolate themselves from others 
                        to contain the virus.
