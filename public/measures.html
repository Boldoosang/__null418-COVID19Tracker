                        Since the virus is mostly spread through human contact, it is 
                        mandatory for people to practise social distancing, i.e limiting contact with
                        others so as to avoid the spread. This would involve staying at home and only
                        going out if it is mandatory for one to do so.
                        Essential workers are those who are needed for the running of important businesses that 
                        must stay open, such as medical facilities, groceries, pharmacies and so on.
                        These workers, as well as anyone who has to leave their home, should follow the steps
                        below to prevent themselves from contracting the virus.

                        The most effective measures for preventing coronavirus 
                        transmission are frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds, 
                        maintaining a distance of 5-6 feet from other people, covering coughs and sneezes 
                        with the inner elbow or tissues and avoiding touching oneâ€™s own face. It is 
                        also recommended that those who exhibit symptoms isolate themselves from others 
                        to contain the virus, or contact medical authorities to be tested and isolated.
