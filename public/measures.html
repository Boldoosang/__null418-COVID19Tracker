                        Since the virus is mostly spread through human contact, it is 
                        mandatory for people to practise social distancing, i.e limiting contact with
                        others so as to avoid the spread. This would involve staying at home and only
                        going out if it is mandatory for one to do so.
                        Essential workers are those who are needed for the running of important businesses that 
                        must stay open, such as medical facilities, groceries, pharmacies and so on.
                        These workers, as well as anyone who have to leave their home, should follow the steps
                        below to prevent themselves from contracting the virus.
